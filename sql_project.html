                    essential skill for any data driven profession.</p>

                            services to Customers at their addresses (You may think of Gas service as an example).
                            Customers subscribe for the service by signing a contract with the company which contains
                            the activation date, the meter number, the address, and the billing rate. The company bills
                            the customer according to their consumption which is measured by Meter installed at their
                            address. Each Meter is assigned a unique number, and the reading of the meter is recorded by
                            a company employee who is assigned the reading task. Each Reader is assigned a list of
                            addresses and Meter numbers to read on specific date. The Reader record the Meter reading
                            and the date it was taken. Then customer consumption is calculated by subtracting the
                            previous reading from the current reading. The cost is calculated by multiplying the
                            customer consumption by the unit rate (specified in the contract). The customers are billed
                            after each reading and given 30 days to pay their bill. A customer may have one or more
                            addresses and consequently may have Multiple Contracts. One Meter is installed at each
                            address. Each Contract is billed separately if the customer has multiple addresses
                            (contracts). Customer can activate or deactivate the service at his address at any date, and
                            these dates should be recorded. Meters are fixed at the installation addresses; however,
                            customers can change their addresses. Consequently, the same meter/address can be assigned
                            to multiple customers but not at the same time-period, so the activation and deactivation
                            dates are important to determine which customer is using which meter at any given time. </p>
